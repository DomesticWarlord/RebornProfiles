**RebornProfiles** is a collection of various OrderBot scripts for [RebornBuddy][7].

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [RebornBuddy][7] with active license (paid)
- [Lisbeth][9] with active license (paid)
- [LlamaLibrary][10] (free)
- Better combat routine, such as [Magitek][11] (free)

### Automatic Setup (recommended)

1. `updateBuddy` now comes pre-installed with RebornBuddy.
2. Once you have the bot up and running, select the `Plugins` tab across the top and find `updateBuddy` on the list of Plugins. Select it, and then hit the `Settings` button on the right side panel.
3. On the `Repos` tab across the top. Make sure the prerequisites and `RebornProfiles` are selected and `updateBuddy` will download/install/ and update those repos for you.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup instead of automatic,

1. Download the [latest version][2].
2. On the `.zip` file, right click > `Properties` > `Unblock` > `Apply`.
3. Unzip all contents into `RebornBuddy\Profiles\` so it looks like this:

```
RebornBuddy
└── Profiles
    └── RebornProfiles
        ├── README.md
        └── ...
```

4. Start RebornBuddy as normal.

## Usage

To load an OrderBot script:

1. Start RebornBuddy and set the BotBase dropdown to `Order Bot`.
2. Click `Load Profile` and navigate to `RebornBuddy\Profiles\RebornProfiles\`.
3. Select the desired `.xml` script from the appropriate subfolder.
4. Back in RebornBuddy, click `Start`.
5. Watch for notifications in the client and logs -- some profiles require intervention!

## Troubleshooting

For live volunteer support, join the [Project BR Discord][4] channel `#support`.

When asking for help, always include:

- which script you loaded,
- what you tried to do,
- what went wrong,
- relevant logs from the `RebornBuddy\Logs\` folder.

No need to ask if anyone's around or for permission to ask -- just go for it!
