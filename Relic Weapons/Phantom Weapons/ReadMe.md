# Zodiac Relic Weapons

This profile will obtain the first tier of the level 100 Dawntrail relics, the Phantom Weapons.

These relics are fairly simple to obtain, with a one time FATE grind and then every relic after just needing Tomestone farms. This profile does the FATE farming and then takes advantage of Panda Farmer to farm the needed Helimotry. 

## Setup

Open the `Phantom Relics.xml` using your favorite text editor to make the initial setup.

The first step of the quest chain farms FATEs in Dawntrail zones. There are settings at the top for whether or not to use Lisbeth travel, blacklist for uncompletable FATEs, minimum progress to join fates, and how many Gemstones you want to build to before cashing in. (For the record the profile is only set up to buy vouchers from EW to spend the gemstones)

After the one te one time Demimateria FATE farm is done, the profile will then farm dungeons using Panda Farmer to obtain the necessary Heliometry to buy the relic. By default the profile runs The Underkeep to obtain Helimotry but you can change the setting to use another dungeon if you prefer. (Note you must have an active Panda Farmer key for dungeon farming to work.)
You'll want to choose which relic to obtain by putting in the proper ItemID for the one you want. I've listed them all in the profile for easy access. (Note that the first relic you obtain will be whatever class you start the profile on. After that you'll want to put in the ID of what relic you want.)
