# Resistance Weapons

This rofile set is designed to obtain your level 80 Resistance Weapons with as little interaction from the user as possible.

## Setup

Before you start, open the Start.xml and set your desired job to 1, all other jobs to 0. Only set one job to 1 or it will confuse the profiles.
You must be level 80 in said job to have it work.

You will also need the latest version of LlamaLibrary installed in your botbases folder which can be found here https://github.com/nt153133/__LlamaLibrary
(Make sure you update before running the profiles, Kayla is constantly making new tags for this set and you'll need the absolute latest.)

All my profiles use LisbethTravels for navigation, meaning you will need Lisbeth for them to work. Saga's new Sextant 2.0 is far suprior to anything else RebornBuddy has to offer and makes for a much smoother questing experience. As such, you will need Lisbeth to make these profiles work. If you don't have it, you can find it here: https://www.siune.io/


## Current Progress

### Resistance Weapons
- [x] Unlock Quests
- [x] Obtaining new resistance weapons. (Needs 1000 Tomestone of Poetics to purchase new one)

### Augmented Resistance Weapons
- [x] Memory farming on fates in Heavansward areas.

### Resistance Recollection
- [x] Memory farming on mobs in Bozjan
* This step will grind mobs in Bozjan right outside the gate to get Bitter memories to drop. It works, but it's slow. You're better off finding a cluster farm group and doing those manually. One thing to note is that as long as you have the quest active, you can get Bitter memories. So you can farm tons of them at once and have them ready for future relics.
