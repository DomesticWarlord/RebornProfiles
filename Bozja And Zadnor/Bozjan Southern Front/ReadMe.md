# Bozjan Souther Front

These profiles are intended to run Bozjan Southern Front for you. Doing FATEs with quests and ranking up along the way.

Don't AFK these. It's Fatebot. You're going to be around a lot of other people. You don't want the bot doing something stupid and you not being able to watch it.

## Setup

Not a whole lot of setup here to do here. Make sure you're on the class you want to level and then start the Start.xml profile. It'll queue you and take care of the rest.

You will also need to install the latest version of [LlamaLibrary](https://github.com/nt153133/__LlamaLibrary). Make sure you update LlamaLibrary before running the profiles, Kayla is constantly making new tags for this set and you'll need the absolute latest.

I'm in the process of changing over all the movement in this profile to be handled by Lisbeth. Saga's new Sextant 2.0 is far superior to anything else RebornBuddy has to offer and makes for a much smoother questing experience. As such, you will need Lisbeth to make these profiles work. If you don't have it, you can find it here: https://www.siune.io/
